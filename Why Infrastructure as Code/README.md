# Traditional IT deployments

The Traditional IT deployments included Business Leaders identifying the business opportunity , Business Analysts gathering the data . The data was then provided to Architect for desiging the solution.<br>
The Architect used to relay on the Infrastructure Team which included field engineers to setup networking, servers and other components required for the infrastructure.<br>
The System admins provisioning the servers , application team deploying the application on the servers and QA Team testing the application.<br>
There were lot of disadvantages for this approach which are as below :
* Lot of Time consuming process
* Prone to Human errors
* No capacity planning leading to resources wastage etc
* No immediate deployments avaialble 

This led to development of various cloud methodologies
